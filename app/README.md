# App Directory - Unlisted Files

This directory contains application files that are accessible via direct URL only.

## Purpose
Files in this directory are:
- **Accessible**: Can be accessed if you know the exact URL
- **Unlisted**: Not indexed by search engines (via robots.txt)
- **Hidden**: Not included in sitemap.xml
- **Unlinked**: Not referenced in main site navigation

## Usage
1. Place your app files in this directory
2. Access them via: `https://www.unique-ue.com/app/your-file.html`
3. Share the direct URL with users who need access

## Security Note
This approach provides "security through obscurity" - files are not truly private.
For actual authentication/authorization, implement proper access controls.
