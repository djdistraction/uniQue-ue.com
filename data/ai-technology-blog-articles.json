This invention by Robert Metcalfe and his team would become the foundation for local area networks (LANs) and modern internet connectivity. The ability to connect computers together efficiently was crucial for the distributed computing systems that would later enable AI research and development.\n\nEthernet's packet-switching technology allowed multiple computers to communicate over shared cables, revolutionizing how data could be shared and processed across networks.\n\n### 1938: Orson Welles' War of the Worlds Broadcast\n\n![War of the Worlds Radio](https://placehold.co/800x400/020418/F000B8?text=Media+Technology)\n\nWhile not strictly AI or computing history, Orson Welles' famous \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast on October 30, 1938, demonstrated the power of media technology to create immersive experiences. The panic caused by the realistic presentation foreshadowed discussions about misinformation and the impact of technology on society - themes that remain relevant in the age of AI-generated content.\n\n### 1995: Internet Explorer 2.0 Released\n\n![Browser Technology](https://placehold.co/800x400/020418/00F6FF?text=Internet+Explorer)\n\nMicrosoft released Internet Explorer 2.0 in October 1995, marking a significant step in making the World Wide Web accessible to mainstream users. This browser helped bring internet technology to millions, creating the connected infrastructure necessary for cloud-based AI services and distributed computing.\n\n## Building the Foundation\n\nThese October 30 events remind us that today's AI innovations stand on decades of networking, computing, and communication technology development.",
