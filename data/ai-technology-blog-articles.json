Soviet scientists used early computer systems to analyze the massive amounts of data generated by the world's most powerful nuclear explosion, pushing the boundaries of what computers could process and analyze.\n\nThis event demonstrated the critical role of computing in complex scientific analysis and paved the way for supercomputing development in both the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\n### 1991: World Wide Web Goes Public\n\n![WWW Launch](https://placehold.co/800x400/020418/F000B8?text=World+Wide+Web)\n\nWhile the exact date varies in historical accounts, late October 1991 marked the period when the World Wide Web became publicly accessible beyond CERN. This revolutionary technology, created by Tim Berners-Lee, would become the foundation for the modern internet and enable the AI revolution that would follow decades later.\n\nThe web's open architecture allowed researchers worldwide to share data and collaborate on AI research in unprecedented ways.\n\n### 2014: AlphaGo Development Announced\n\n![DeepMind AlphaGo](https://placehold.co/800x400/020418/00F6FF?text=AlphaGo)\n\nIn October 2014, Google DeepMind announced significant progress on AlphaGo, the AI system that would go on to defeat world champion Go player Lee Sedol in 2016. This marked a major milestone in AI development, demonstrating that machines could master complex strategic games previously thought to require human intuition.\n\n## The March of Progress\n\nThese October 30 milestones show how technology and AI have evolved from supporting nuclear science to creating systems that rival human cognition.",
